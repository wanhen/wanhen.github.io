    <h1>Hello World</h1>
        
    <p>
        My name is <strong>Wawan Hendrawan</strong>        
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I work as an IT Manager in a food distribution company. I have completed several projects that were company goals, including enhancing the utilization of the ERP system, automating and digitizing workflows to improve time and resource efficiency, and developing new technology-based solutions for the company's operations.

        Throughout my career, I have been mostly involved in the development of Information Systems and Technology, and how they add value to the company. I strongly believe that technology is not always a cost; I try to empower technology that is appropriate for the company, in accordance with its scale and field. I call it practical technology atau "Teknologi Tepat Guna".
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of application development, for example, I am not someone who only focuses on a specific technology or programming language to achieve the desired output. I can use Windows-based development technologies for desktop applications, and at other times I can also develop web applications using web-based technologies when deemed necessary.
    </p>

        In my two previous companies, I developed an application within the scope of an ERP system that handles almost all of the company's business processes. The scope of the general business processes starts from customer leads, prospects, to sales orders, order management and fulfillment, inventory and warehousing, as well as standard accounting systems. I developed it using Microsoft .NET using Visual Studio tools, Microsoft SQL Server Database, and Crystal Report. The application is used by more than 30 users and has been running well to this day. This application has had a significant impact on how employees work with data, as the previously separate data in several departments is now centralized into one database accessible by all departments, which is more efficient. In addition, the integration of processes within the application and workflow makes communication between departments much easier.

        As technology continues to rapidly evolve, companies must also adapt to it. As someone who is involved in leveraging information technology for companies, I always try to absorb the latest technologies that can be utilized to provide more value to the company. In my current company, I am trying to develop new solutions using the latest technology. Among them, we developed a solution for monitoring the distribution process from loading goods from the warehouse to delivery to the customer. We record all the information that occurs in the delivery process so that the company has more data. We are aiming to have a big data for data analysis and data science purposes. Of course, an application that handles processes like this is no longer a desktop application. We developed a mobile application using React Native technology, supported by Laravel Lumen for API and Linux platform for server infrastructure. Our application also uses API as a business layer to the database and is equipped with a back-office application that can monitor processes in real-time, complete with dashboard and adequate reporting tools.
